# Green and Gold  

Farming and mining MMORPG based on Minecraft  

## RavensQuest  

Servers work like Minecraft servers, except that you connect via a web browser instead of a standalone client.

To run server:  
`npm run start`  

Biomes:  
Badlands  
Banks  
Treetops  


Lands of Good Mourning  
The Salts  
The Suspension  
  The air becomes heavy enough to swim through.  
Nomadic Docks  
Land of Pisces  

Biome generator should return biomes by percentage.(?)
Write terrain generation in C++, fighting class bloat.
Maybe try Scala to reduce class bloat.
