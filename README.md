Servers work like Minecraft servers, except that you connect via a web browser instead of a standalone client.

To run server:  
`npx webpack`  
`npm run start`  

* Chunk - holds blocks  
* First-person - controls player movement, camera, collisions, etc.  
* Scene - a babylon scene that contains the active game  
* View - how the game is displayed in the browser  
* World - a group of chunks
